                The Triumph Thruxton R is a cafe racer based on the Bonneville family. It is a gorgeous looking motorcycle with cafe racer design elements in the form of a round headlamp, clip ons, sculpted fuel tank, minimal body panels, rearset footpegs, solo seat, rear cowl and upswept exhausts. 
                <br>The Thruxton R gets a host of modern features like ride-by-wire, rider modes, traction control and ABS.
                <br>The 1200cc liquid-cooled parallel twin motor delivers 97PS and 112Nm of torque with 100Nm available from as low as 2500rpm. 
                <br>The sporty frame combined with the top spec suspension parts make this a highly involving motorcycle. Ride quality, despite its sporty intentions, is quite good as are the ergonomics. 
                <br>The Thruxton R is priced at Rs 11.92 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). It is not exactly a practical everyday bike but that can be forgiven for its performance and rider involvement.
